# Tabgrep - basic tab functionality

a _Personal-use_ Chrome extension which provides quick searching of open tabs and other conveniences

## This is not production-ready code

Really just made to make my life less painful

Initially I just want to be able to search for a particular tab by name / title

Eventually would be nice to rig up additional features like content-grepping and so forth

## Basic use

This extension hooks into Chrome's custom searches.

typing `;` in the address bar, followed by `<TAB>` or `<SPACE>` gets you into the search context, after that:

- type words or phrases to search all tabs for that string
- type `audio:` (or just `aud:`) to list all tabs which are making sound


# Grunt ignore command

`gi node,grunt`
